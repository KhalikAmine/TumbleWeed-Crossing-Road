# TumbleWeed-Crossing-Road
This is a game where a tumbleweed will be crossing the screen while cars are trying to hit it. 
This is a project that was done at my junior college in my problem solving 1 class it is using a Game class that my instructor provided for those that were in the class.
line 100 - line 205 is the code that i wrote for this Game that makes the tumbleWeed cross the road.
