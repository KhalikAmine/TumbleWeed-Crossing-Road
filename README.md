# TumbleWeed-Crossing-Road
Welcome to my game where a tumbleweed will be crossing the screen while cars are trying to hit it. This application consists of 3 cars that are going at different speeds to try and hit the tumbleweed that is crossing the road. The tumbleweed is controlled using the arrow keys on the keyboard. This was my second game to help with my Java programming journey and learn new concepts. 
line 100 - line 205 is the code that I wrote for this Game that makes the tumbleWeed cross the road. The rest of the code is written by my professor 

## Features

- Game Concept: Controlling a tumbleweed crossing the road while avoiding getting hit by cars.
- Objective: Control the tumbleweed to get to the other side and win the game.
- Gameplay: The player controls the tumbleweed by using the arrow keys on the keyboard
  The cars move horizontally to try to hit the tumbleweed.
  Collisions are indicated when either the tumbleweed or the car interacts with one another.

  ## Future updates
- I plan on adding multiple difficulties.
- To implement a score so players can strive to beat their best score.
